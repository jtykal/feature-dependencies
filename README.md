# MS Dependencies

## Summary/Description

![screenshot](./screenshot.png "This is an example")
This is a customer-specific app. You'll likely encounter problems using it in any subscription other than the one it was created for. You've been warned...

Show stories or Portfolio Items and their dependencies. Color code the dependencies based on their
schedule. The app respects page-level timebox filtering for those work item types that support it.

The app will automatically detect the name of the  portfolio items (portfolioitem/feature is the default), so this will work in environments that have custom portfolio item names.

For higher level portfolio items (i.e. above features), the app will color code both of the main artifacts start/end dates with the current 'health' color of the artifact.

A number of fields are hard-coded as default columns to be displayed - including some custom fields used by the target customer.

By default, only items with dependencies are shown, but this can be changed within the app.

### Colors Used:
* Primary Artifact Colors
  * Grey - primary artifact is unscheduled. No colors used for predecessors or successors
* Predecessor Colors
  * Red - predecessor is scheduled AFTER the primary artifact
  * Yellow - predecessor is scheduled in the same timebox as the primary artifact
* Successor Colors
  * Red - successor is scheduled BEFORE the primary artifact
  * Yellow - successor is scheduled in the same timebox as the primary artifact
  * Grey - successor is unscheduled 

## Usage Notes

### Export Limitations

* The export file will only include the records that are visible on the page (default pageSize has been set to 500). You can increase the page size to a maximum of 1000 records. If your data set exceeds 1000 records, you will need to do multiple exports, one for each page of data.
* Some reference fields (such as Tags and Milestones) export a count of items, not the actual item names as are visible on the screen.
* Some punctuation and special characters cannot be exported into a delimited text file, so the data in your export may not exactly match the data you see on the screen.

## Development Notes

### First Load

If you've just downloaded this from github and you want to do development,
you're going to need to have these installed:

 * node.js
 * grunt-cli
 * grunt-init

Since you're getting this from github, we assume you have the command line
version of git also installed.  If not, go get git.

If you have those three installed, just type this in the root directory here
to get set up to develop:

  npm install

#### Deployment & Tests

If you want to use the automatic deployment mechanism, be sure to use the
**makeauth** task with grunt to create a local file that is used to connect
to Rally.  This resulting auth.json file should NOT be checked in.

### Structure

  * src/javascript:  All the JS files saved here will be compiled into the
  target html file
  * src/style: All of the stylesheets saved here will be compiled into the
  target html file
  * test/fast: Fast jasmine tests go here.  There should also be a helper
  file that is loaded first for creating mocks and doing other shortcuts
  (fastHelper.js) **Tests should be in a file named <something>-spec.js**
  * test/slow: Slow jasmine tests go here.  There should also be a helper
  file that is loaded first for creating mocks and doing other shortcuts
  (slowHelper.js) **Tests should be in a file named <something>-spec.js**
  * templates: This is where templates that are used to create the production
  and debug html files live.  The advantage of using these templates is that
  you can configure the behavior of the html around the JS.
  * config.json: This file contains the configuration settings necessary to
  create the debug and production html files.  
  * package.json: This file lists the dependencies for grunt
  * auth.json: This file should NOT be checked in.  This file is needed for deploying
  and testing.  You can use the makeauth task to create this or build it by hand in this'
  format:
    {
        "username":"you@company.com",
        "password":"secret",
        "server": "https://rally1.rallydev.com"
    }

### Usage of the grunt file
#### Tasks

##### grunt debug

Use grunt debug to create the debug html file.  You only need to run this when you have added new files to
the src directories.

##### grunt build

Use grunt build to create the production html file.  We still have to copy the html file to a panel to test.

##### grunt test-fast

Use grunt test-fast to run the Jasmine tests in the fast directory.  Typically, the tests in the fast
directory are more pure unit tests and do not need to connect to Rally.

##### grunt test-slow

Use grunt test-slow to run the Jasmine tests in the slow directory.  Typically, the tests in the slow
directory are more like integration tests in that they require connecting to Rally and interacting with
data.

##### grunt deploy

Use grunt deploy to build the deploy file and then install it into a new page/app in Rally.  It will create the page on the Home tab and then add a custom html app to the page.  The page will be named using the "name" key in the config.json file (with an asterisk prepended).

You can use the makeauth task to create this file OR construct it by hand.  Caution: the
makeauth task will delete this file.

The auth.json file must contain the following keys:
{
    "username": "fred@fred.com",
    "password": "fredfredfred",
    "server": "https://us1.rallydev.com"
}

(Use your username and password, of course.)  NOTE: not sure why yet, but this task does not work against the demo environments.  Also, .gitignore is configured so that this file does not get committed.  Do not commit this file with a password in it!

When the first install is complete, the script will add the ObjectIDs of the page and panel to the auth.json file, so that it looks like this:

{
    "username": "fred@fred.com",
    "password": "fredfredfred",
    "server": "https://us1.rallydev.com",
    "pageOid": "52339218186",
    "panelOid": 52339218188
}

On subsequent installs, the script will write to this same page/app. Remove the
pageOid and panelOid lines to install in a new place.  CAUTION:  Currently, error checking is not enabled, so it will fail silently.

##### grunt watch

Run this to watch files (js and css).  When a file is saved, the task will automatically build, run fast tests, and deploy as shown in the deploy section above.

##### grunt makeauth

This task will create an auth.json file in the proper format for you.  **Be careful** this will delete any existing auth.json file.  See **grunt deploy** to see the contents and use of this file.
